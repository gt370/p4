### Question 4

First we subset coal combustion source factors NEI data.

```{r combustion,cache=TRUE}
# Subset coal combustion related NEI data
combustionRelated <- grepl("comb", SCC$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case=TRUE)
coalRelated <- grepl("coal", SCC$SCC.Level.Four, ignore.case=TRUE) 
coalCombustion <- (combustionRelated & coalRelated)
combustionSCC <- SCC[coalCombustion,]$SCC
combustionNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% combustionSCC,]
```

Note:  The SCC levels go from generic to specific. We assume that coal combustion related SCC records are those where SCC.Level.One contains the substring 'comb' and SCC.Level.Four contains the substring 'coal'.

```{r plot4}
library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(combustionNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions/10^5)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Coal Combustion Source Emissions Across US from 1999-2008"))
print(ggp)
```

**Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?**

Emissions from coal combustion related sources have decreased from 6 * 10^6 to below 4 * 10^6 from 1999-2008.

Eg. Emissions from coal combustion related sources have decreased by about 1/3 from 1999-2008!
